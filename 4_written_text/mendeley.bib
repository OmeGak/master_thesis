abstract = {Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux, due to recent upheavals in our view of mass loss, and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are now thought to be lower by a factor of 2-3 compared to rates adopted in modern stellar evolution models, due to the influence of clumping. Weaker line-driven winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal elsewhere, so that the dominant modes of mass loss are the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse. The shifting emphasis from steady winds to episodic mass loss is a major change for low-metallicity regions, since eruptions and binary mass transfer are less sensitive to metallicity. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models beyond core H burning. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation in models has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, as it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. This alters our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss --- are WR stars and SNe Ibc the products of single-star winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This paradigm shift has far-reaching impact on a number of other areas of astronomy. (abridged)},

It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. While the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars towards their violent end stage. We show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows to sketch the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues.

As a result, we obtain the scattering function in the form of a cubic polynomial in optical thickness. The author has already solved the same problem by iterative integrations of Chandrasekhar's integral equation. In the Milne integral equation, both the cosines of the viewing angles and the optical thickness are integral variables, while in Chandrasekhar's integral equation the cosines of the viewing angles are variables but the optical thickness is not. We derive several series of exponential-like functions as intermediate derivations. Their convergences are evaluated by the author's previous work in the solution of Chandrasekhar's integral equation. The truncated scattering function up to the third order in optical thickness thus obtained is identical to that obtained from Chandrasekhar's integral equation, though their apparent forms are different. Chandrasekhar pointed out that the solution of Chandrasekhar's integral equation does not have a uniqueness of solution. The Milne equation, in contrast, has been proven to have a unique solution. We discuss the uniqueness of the solution by these two methods. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Focusing on the interplay of radiative flux and opacity, with emphasis on key distinctions between continuum vs. line opacity, this chapter reviews instabilities in the envelopes and winds of VMS. Specifically, we discuss how: 1) the iron opacity bump can induce an extensive inflation of the stellar envelope; 2) the density dependence of mean opacity leads to strange mode instabilities in the outer envelope; 3) desaturation of line-opacity by acceleration of near-surface layers initiates and sustains a line-driven stellar wind outflow; 4) an associated line-deshadowing instability leads to extensive small-scale structure in the outer regions of such line-driven winds; 5) a star with super-Eddington luminosity can develop extensive atmospheric structure from photon bubble instabilities, or from stagnation of flow that exceeds the "photon tiring" limit; 6) the associated porosity leads to a reduction in opacity that can regulate the extreme mass loss of such continuum-driven winds. Two overall themes are the potential links of such instabilities to Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and the potential role of radiation forces in establishing the upper mass limit of VMS.},

abstract = {Radiative transfer theory has mirrored many of the trends in the development of applied mathematics during the past century. It began with the development of the phenomenological equation of transfer at the start of the century, designed to treat the passage of light through foggy opaque atmospheres. By the mid-1940s, the theory provided detailed modeling of stellar and planetary atmospheres and subsequently transformed into the remote sensing problem of remote diagnoses of physical conditions and abundances in such environments. During the late 1940s, the need to treat neutron transfer in complex geometries led to an interest in applying these methods to nuclear reactors, using methods of invariant imbedding. Monte Carlo simulations, and integral equations, all areas of continuing study. The formative period, mainly analytic in thrust, ended by the mid-1960s with the comprehensive treatises by Chandrasekhar, Ambartsumian, Kourganoff, Busbridge, Sobolev, and Davison and the 11th AMS Applied Mathematics Symposium on nuclear reactors. Invariant imbedding and doubling methods have been widely developed for scattering problems, mainly in planetary atmospheres and nebular transfer, while improvements in computational methods over the past 30 years have introduced advances in multidimensional, multigroup transfer codes for neutron physics (Boltzmann equation solvers), neutrinos, and significant advances in radiative transfer and the growth of the field of radiation hydrodynamics 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Context. Mass loss is essential for massive star evolution, thus also for the variety of astrophysical applications relying on its predictions. However, mass-loss rates currently in use for hot, massive stars have recently been seriously questioned, mainly because of the effects of wind clumping. Aims: We investigate the impact of clumping on diagnostic ultraviolet resonance and optical recombination lines often used to derive empirical mass-loss rates of hot stars. Optically thick clumps, a non-void interclump medium, and a non-monotonic velocity field are all accounted for in a single model. The line formation is first theoretically studied, after which an exemplary multi-diagnostic study of an O-supergiant is performed. Methods: We used 2D and 3D stochastic and radiation-hydrodynamic wind models, constructed by assembling 1D snapshots in radially independent slices. To compute synthetic spectra, we developed and used detailed radiative transfer codes for both recombination lines (solving the "formal integral") and resonance lines (using a Monte-Carlo approach). In addition, we propose an analytic method to model these lines in clumpy winds, which does not rely on optically thin clumping. Results: The importance of the "vorosity" effect for line formation in clumpy winds is emphasized. Resonance lines are generally more affected by optically thick clumping than recombination lines. Synthetic spectra calculated directly from current radiation-hydrodynamic wind models of the line-driven instability are unable to in parallel reproduce strategic optical and ultraviolet lines for the Galactic O-supergiant $\lambda$ Cep. Using our stochastic wind models, we obtain consistent fits essentially by increasing the clumping in the inner wind. A mass-loss rate is derived that is approximately two times lower than what is predicted by the line-driven wind theory, but much higher than the corresponding rate derived when assuming optically thin clumps. Our analytic formulation for line formation is used to demonstrate the potential importance of optically thick clumping in diagnostic lines in so-called weak-winded stars and to confirm recent results that resonance doublets may be used as tracers of wind structure and optically thick clumping. Conclusions: We confirm earlier results that a re-investigation of the structures in the inner wind predicted by line-driven instability simulations is needed. Our derived mass-loss rate for $\lambda$ Cep suggests that only moderate reductions of current mass-loss predictions for OB-stars are necessary, but this nevertheless prompts investigations on feedback effects from optically thick clumping on the steady-state, NLTE wind models used for quantitative spectroscopy.},

abstract = {If we would, at all times and at all locations, know the values of j $\nu$ and $\alpha$ $\nu$ , then what we have learned in Chapter 3 would be enough to understand the topic of radiative transfer. Of course, some technical details still have to be refined, and we have to discuss all the " input physics " such as opacities and abundances of constituents of the medium. But those would be manageable. When you hear that radiative transfer is a very challenging topic, the reason is that in many cases we do not know the values of j $\nu$ and/or $\alpha$ $\nu$ in advance. The radiation field I $\nu$ (x, n) that we wish to compute can affect the medium in such a way as to modify j $\nu$ and $\alpha$ $\nu$ . We are then faced with a " chicken or egg " effect: to compute I $\nu$ (x, n) we need to know j $\nu$ (x) and $\alpha$ $\nu$ (x), and to compute j $\nu$ (x) and $\alpha$ $\nu$ (x) we need to know I $\nu$ (x, n). And to make things worse: we cannot solve this problem for each ray separately, because a change in j $\nu$ (x) will affect the formal transfer equation for all rays passing through x, i.e. rays with different direction vectors n. This is illustrated in the figure B C A Ray coupling Line of sight in the margin. For our observation we are interested in the formal radiative transfer along ray A, which we call the line of sight. We focus in this illustration on the j $\nu$ and $\alpha$ $\nu$ in the little cell at the center of the cloud. In addition to ray, A, also rays B and C pass through that cell. The intensity along those rays can therefore also affect j $\nu$ and $\alpha$ $\nu$ in the cell. This ray coupling effect means that we are forced to solve the radiative transfer problem for all rays at once. This is the true challenge of radiative transfer. This challenge can also be expressed in terms of radiative cell coupling: the emission generated in one volume element of a cloud (a " cell ") can travel to the other side of the cloud and affect the conditions in a cell there. Information is thus exchanged be-tween regions of the cloud that are distant from each other. For example: the radiative cooling of one region can cause the radiative heating of another. While this may seem like a separate problem from the ray coupling problem, it is actually the same. The cell coupling and ray coupling problems are just two faces of the same problem.},

abstract = {We present examples of macroscopic systems entailing a quantum mechanical structure. One of our examples has a structure which is isomorphic to the spin structure for a spin 1/2 and another system entails a structure isomorphic to the structure of two spin 1/2 in the entangled singlet state. We elaborate this system by showing that an arbitrary tensor product state representing two entangled qubits can be described in a complete way by a specific internal constraint between the ray or density states of the two qubits, which describes the behavior of the state of one of the spins if measurements are executed on the other spin. Since any n-qubit unitary operation can be decomposed into 2-qubit gates and unary operations, we argue that our representation of 2-qubit entanglement contributes to a better understanding of the role of n-qubit entanglement in quantum computation. We illustrate our approach on two 2-qubit algorithms proposed by Deutsch, respectively Arvind et al. One of the advantages of the 2-qubit case besides its relative simplicity is that it allows for a nice geometrical representation of entanglement, which contributes to a more intuitive grasp of what is going on in a 2-qubit quantum computation. 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In other words, it is a region where the radiation, observable by a d i s t a n t o b-server, originates. Since in the vast majority of cases the radiation is the only information about a distant astronomical object we h a ve (exceptions being a direct detection of solar wind particles, neutrinos from the Sun and SN 1987a, or gravitational waves), all the information we gather about stars is derived from analysis of their radiation. It is therefore of considerable importance to develop reliable methods which are able to decode the information about a star contained in its spectrum with conndence. Having understood the physics of the problem and being able to carry out detailed numerical simulations will enable us to construct theoretical models of a stellar atmosphere and predict a stellar spectrum. This has important applications in other branches of astrophysics, such as i) derived stellar parameters can be used to verify predictions of the stellar evolution theoryy ii) models provide ionizing guxes for the interstellar medium and nebular modelss iii) predicted stellar spectra are basic blocks for population syntheses of stellar clusters, starburst regions, and whole galaxies. Moreover, very hot and massive stars have special signiicance. They are very bright, and therefore may be studied spectroscopically as individual objects in distant galaxies. Reliable model atmospheres for these stars may therefore yield invaluable independent information about distant galaxies, like c hemical composition, and, possibly, reliable distances. This alone would easily substantiate viewing the stellar atmosphere theory as an independent, and very important, branch of modern astrophysics. Yet, in the global astrophysical context, there is another, and equally important, contribution of the stellar atmospheres theory. Stellar atmospheres are the best studied example of a medium where radiation is not only a probe of the physical state, but is in fact an important constituent. In other words, radiation in fact determines the structure of the medium, yet the medium is probed only by this radiation.},

abstract = {In the Spoken Dialogue System literature, all studies consider the dialogue move as the unquestionable unit for reinforcement learning. Rather than learning at the dialogue move level, we apply the learning at the design level for three reasons: 1/ to alleviate the high-skill prerequisite for developers, 2/ to reduce the learning complexity by taking into account just the relevant subset of the context and 3/ to have interpretable learning results that carry a reusable usage feedback. Unfortunately, tackling the problem at the design level breaks the Markovian assumptions that are required in most Reinforcement Learning techniques. Consequently, we decided to use a recent non-Markovian algorithm called Compliance Based Reinforcement Learning. This paper presents the first experimentation on online optimisation in dialogue systems. It reveals a fast and significant improvement of the system performance with by average one system misunderstanding less per dialogue. 2010 ISCA.},

abstract = {Tensor analysis is the type of subject that can make even the best of students shudder. My own post-graduate instructor in the subject took away much of the fear by speaking of an implicit rhythm in the peculiar notation traditionally used, and helped us to see how this rhythm plays its way throughout the various formalisms. Prior to taking that class, I had spent many years playing on my own with tensors. I found the going to be tremendously difficult but was able, over time, to back out some physical and geometrical consider- ations that helped to make the subject a little more transparent. Today, it is sometimes hard not to think in terms of tensors and their associated concepts. This article, prompted and greatly enhanced by Marlos Jacob, whom Ive met only by e-mail, is an attempt to record those early notions concerning tensors. It is intended to serve as a bridge from the point where most undergraduate students leave off in their studies of mathematics to the place where most texts on tensor analysis begin. A basic knowledge of vectors, matrices, and physics is assumed. A semi-intuitive approach to those notions underlying tensor analysis is given via scalars, vectors, dyads, triads, and higher vector products. The reader must be prepared to do some mathematics and to think. For those students who wish to go beyond this humble start, I can only recommend my professors wisdom: find the rhythm in the mathematics and you will fare pretty well.},

abstract = {Abstract A multiscale simulation framework for polycondensation and other types of polymerization mechanisms, which is used to study the hyperbranched polymerization of AB2 type monomer 4,4-bis-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid is presented. The reaction framework is established by combining the coarse-grained molecular dynamics and the reactive Monte Carlo method, in which the coarse-grained molecular dynamics handles the diffusion of particles and the reactive Monte Carlo method determines the bond formation. The influence of parameters in the simulation model on the quality of the simulation results is explicitly evaluated. Specific guidelines on how to choose proper values for the simulation model parameters are given here. It is shown that i) the reaction interval should be chosen from the ballistic region of the diffusion profile; and ii) the first valley of the radial distribution function of reactants is a good value for the reaction capture radius for polycondensation in terms of accuracy of the calculations. Moreover, a recipe to determine the rate constant from the kinetic equation is explicitly proposed. Using the guidelines, excellent agreement between simulation results and the experimental data is obtained.},

abstract = {We develop a new Monte Carlo method that solves hyperbolic transport equations with stiff terms, characterized by a (small) scaling parameter. In particular, we focus on systems which lead to a reduced problem of parabolic type in the limit when the scaling parameter tends to zero. Classical Monte Carlo methods suffer severe time step limitations in these situations, due to the fact that the characteristic speeds go to infinity in the diffusion limit. This makes the problem a real challenge, since the scaling parameter may differ by several orders of magnitude in the domain. To circumvent these time step limitations, we construct a new, asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo method that is stable independently of the scaling parameter and degenerates to a standard probabilistic approach for solving the limiting equation in the diffusion limit. The method uses an implicit time discretization to formulate a modified equation in which the characteristic speeds do not grow indefinitely when the scaling factor tends to zero. The resulting modified equation can readily be discretized by a Monte Carlo scheme, in which the particles combine a finite propagation speed with a time step dependent diffusion term. We show the performance of the method by comparing it with standard (deterministic) approaches in the literature.},

abstract = {In many astrophysical situations, radiation plays an important role in the dynamics of the system. Hot massive stars, for example, have powerful radiation-driven stellar winds with mass loss rates that can exceed 10^{-6} solar masses per year. In this thesis, a hydrodynamics code MPI-AMRVAC is modified and used to simulate radiation effects using two different formalisms: First, the focus is on highly accelerating media that are optically thick to continuum radiation. A spectral line driving formalism is introduced and used to simulate the winds of hot, massive stars. Second, a more general approach is developed by solving the complete radiation hydrodynamics equations. The line driving formalism, called CAK-theory, has analytical solutions which are compared to our simulations with good agreement. Having implemented and benchmarked such a CAK-routine in MPI-AMRVAC, future work will focus on simulating the interaction of a hot massive star wind with a compact object by means of accretion. The second approach in this thesis uses the flux limited diffusion approximation. We start with working out some test cases to check on the implementation of the code. Afterwards, we try our hand at 2D simulations of a radiation-dominated massive-star atmosphere, comparing results to theoretical predictions from perturbation theory. Here, future work will focus on further investigation of radiation-instabilities occurring in such atmospheres for stars near the stellar upper mass limit.},
