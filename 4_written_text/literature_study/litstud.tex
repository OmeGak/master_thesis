\begin{itemize}
\item General guidelines for good practices in scientific computing are found in \cite{Wilson2014}.

\item I went to the 2019 Petnica Summer school in Petnica, Serbia. This was a good general introduction and overview to astrophysics.

\item A very interesting article about Monte Carlo methods for radiative transfer problems, from a mathematical point of view, is \cite{Dimarco2018}. I am currently trying to reproduce the numerical experiments that are reported in the article.
